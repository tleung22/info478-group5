# Exploratory Analysis

```{r distribution,}
boxplot(state_data$percent_mde,
        main = "Percent of Youths with > 1 MDE",
        xlab = "Percent of Youths",
        horizontal = TRUE)
```

As shown above, on average, states have about 14.20922% of youths with at least one major depressive episode.

```{r coverage_treatment, echo=FALSE}
plot(coverage_vs_treatment)
```
  
In this plot, we compared among states the number of youths whose private
insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems to the number of youths
with MDE who did not receive any mental health services.
